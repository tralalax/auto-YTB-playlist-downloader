# auto-YTB-playlist-downloader
An Android APP to automatically download new songs that you add to a YouTube playlist.

The application checks every 24 hours if there is any new song in a youtube playlist, if so, it downloads them automatically.

I'm still working on this application, and this is the first release, so if you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
